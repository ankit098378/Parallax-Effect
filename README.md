# Parallax-Effect
 In the colorful palette of web design, the parallax effect is like the sparkle that makes everything pop. 
 Ever visited a website and noticed how some parts seem to move slower or faster as you scroll?

That’s the parallax effect in action!

It makes websites look flashy and dynamic, adding a splash of life to them.

So, what exactly is the Parallax Effect?

Simply put, it’s a COOL visual trick that makes objects closer to us seem to move faster than objects farther away, creating a sense of depth and movement.
